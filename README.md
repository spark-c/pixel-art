# pixel-art

I've been making pixel art here-and-there, and this repo is a place to keep it for my own reference and in case anyone else wanted to see!

## /weekly-challenges
This directory holds the art I've created for the weekly prompts posted by the Twitter account at [@LearnPixelArt](https://twitter.com/learnpixelart)
